# Fall-2018-Data-Bootcamp-Final-Project---Richard-Yang
Project Description

Portfolio management is the science of decision making about investment mix and balancing risk against performance. In this project, we look at some risky assets to examine and calculate their indivudal returns (by month). Then, we attempt to find the "best" portfolio, a combination of these risky assets, to see if there is a way for us to generate higher returns than any of the individual assets are able to. We examine how these returns are correlated with risk. Does risk matter in the pursuit of returns? Would it, in fact, be best to just invest in risk-free US Treasury Bonds? We test a combination of different portfolios, made up of different assets, to see if we can answer these questions.
